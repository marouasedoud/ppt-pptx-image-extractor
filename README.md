PowerPoint Image Extractor üñºÔ∏è

## Overview

This code was developed for personal use during the creation of a machine learning database. If you find yourself in a similar situation where you need to extract numerous images from multiple PowerPoint files, this script can be a valuable tool. By providing the file names in a list, you can effortlessly extract every image present in any slide of those files. The extracted images will be saved individually in the file directory, and a comprehensive collection will be compiled into a single `final_file.docx` document.


## Notes

- Ensure that the PowerPoint files are in the same directory as the script.
- Images will be saved in the same directory as the script.
- The `final_file.docx` will contain all the extracted images.
